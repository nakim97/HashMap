# HashMap and MinHeap Implementation

This is a Portfolio Project for the class CS261 (Data Structures) at OSU implementing Hash Map and Min Heap.

# Hash Map 
This hash map uses a hash table of buckets, each containing a linked list of hash links. Each hash link stores the key-value pair (string and object in this case) and a pointer to the next link in the list. 

# Min Heap
This min heap uses a dynamic array to implement the complete binary tree heap in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
